# DataBase Setup.
Copy Database "MDF" and "LDF" files and attached them to local SQL server.
---OR---
Copy DBscript.sql file from src/Database Folder and run it SQL Server Management Studio

There are 2 table "Users" and "UserPermission" created.
if you attached direct MDF file to SQL server then data will be there and then use

You can check it from data tabel stored in plain text as it is just for demo did not use any data encryption.
